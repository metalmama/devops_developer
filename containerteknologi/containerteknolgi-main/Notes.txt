Notes

This is how I set it up.

Installed docker desktop for Windows (comes with docker compose)

Define the application dependencies.

In commmand prompt

$ mkdir containerteknologi
$ cd containerteknologi

so the project directory it looks like this:

Users\nightwitches\containerteknologi

Create folder /flaskapp and /mysql in this location

in directory /flaskapp create:

app.py
requirements.txt
Dockerfile 

in directory /mysql create:
Dockerfile
init.sql

Go back to /containerteknologi directory and create:

docker-compose.yml

From my project directory (see above) start my application by running $ docker-compose up

From another terminal window type docker image ls to list local images to check that it is all running

Edit the compose file to include a definition of a mysql-service, a flaskapp-service, a volume and a network

When I first tried to run it I could not get the flaskapp container to connect to the mysql container. 

I figured that the problem was in the python code and attempted to run the app.py and the mysql locally on linux subsystem in Windows. 
This also failed as the cursor command was not taking place within the app context and port number was supplied by a string.

Sorted the code and then I could run the application.
